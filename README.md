# Group TODO List

*Group TODO List* is a really useful tool for groups to list all their plans to a public list, which they can access from anywhere in the world and see the same and synchronized todo list. This project mainly uses JavaScript and builds up a user-interactive service through Firebase from Google. Several key terms that I learned recently such as asynchronous functions, OOP in JS, local storage, and databases are used in this project.
